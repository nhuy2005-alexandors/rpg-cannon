**Critical lore:** Edran = Tư Tế Xương; Maela = nữ thợ săn; Kharzug = chiến thú già Tam Nha; unnamed Huyết Lang pup. Historically alive T93; all four reconfirmed at temple T154, Kharzug still recovering. Kharzug is NOT the one-eyed wolf killed at T66. The Tam Trảo bone tripwire is not disarmed.

**Sync policy:** GitHub is the authority, Notion is a derived lookup. Flush by checkpoint/major event/session switch, no unattended background auto-capture. Immutable imported source documents in sources/drive/ are evidence, not competing current-state copies.

## Notion Knowledge Graph V1 (LIVE snapshot T153)

- [Hắc Nhật Context Hub](https://app.notion.com/p/3fe864d295ce817895aed0bcfde6ac34)
- [Entities database](https://app.notion.com/p/3e1a70d007444496874d9e9535071d6a) — nine canonical IDs
- [Relationships database](https://app.notion.com/p/4ea8c07ae96d4312b585acab207bc370) — seven directed evidence-backed edges
- [Registry and saved Notion views](graph/notion-registry.json); [initial verification receipts](verification/graph-receipts/initial-import.md)

Notion is only a read-optimized graph, **not a second source of truth**. GitHub remains canon for RPG numerical state and accepted world events. The projected source commit was `c47ba6254b042f016f8f53aafb2af346173674e4` (later docs/test commits do not imply changed gameplay). Current last verified RPG turn is T160; T161 has not started. Vô Danh chose Tốc Mạch as a research focus only. Vaelthar offered specialized Tam Đoạn Tốc Mạch trial (~25m, 9 BLOOD +15 STA at start, non-guaranteed); no practice, consumption or Huyết Bộc unlock in T160. HP115/170, STA110/110, BLOOD15/50, TH0, souls5; Hấp Huyết Lv1 already learned. Huyết Bộc Cực Hạn remains theory and Hấp Huyết Lv2 unearned. Notion graph remains a T153 historical projection until updated. No background chat ingestion or timed auto-sync is installed.

## GM storyline mechanics V1

- [Story arc registry](story/arcs.json) — long-lived story threads and evidence-qualified lifecycle: Tam Nha, Kharzug & pup, sealed vessel, resolved Huyết Lang Vương.
- [Next action catalog](story/actions.json) — up to four grounded suggestions, not accepted quests; excludes old resolved boss and the obsolete “Cứu Maela” option.
- [Story policy functions](story/engine.py) and [regression tests](verification/test_story_engine.py) — lifecycle transitions, available actions and checkpoint triggers.
- [Game Master operational protocol](docs/gm-storyline-protocol.md) — how to integrate the above in each played turn. No unattended chat ingestion or background sync currently exists.
